    <h2>Razor Handle</h2>
    <p> This handle was a process of looking at ergonomics and accesability for all who could use it. </br>
      The model first went through numerous studies to determine a good ergonomic fit, </br>
      and was then casted using a smooth-cast hard plastic. </br> </br>
    This design was developed with Maddie Fung for Des 301 at the University of Alberta</p>

    <h2>Sheltered Playground Design</h2>
    <p> Using the Queen Elizabeth Park in Vancouver, British Columbia as a backdrop, the idea of combining play</br>
       and shelter is important, especially when you consider Vancouver's typical rainy weather The playground </br>
       would effectively provide an area to play, and if inclement comes, provides an area of shelter for those </br>
       who may be caught in the affect area. </br> </br>

    <h2>HomeHub Software</h2>
    <p> The HomeHub software idea was born out of the concept of brand agnosticism. While </br>
      major brands in today's IoT Smarthome market limit the products that can be used </br>
      with eachother, the idea of controlling all the of the pieces with a central software </br>
      that isn't locked to a manufacturer's compatability list just makes sense. Software would </br>
      be developed in modules, with each module enacting with a device's API on the network.</br> </br>
